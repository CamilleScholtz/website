**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.1](/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.1.tar.xz)
has been released.

The first bug-fix release fixes several serious bugs: two crash bugs
in the `curl` input plugin, one crash bug in the `wavpack` decoder
plugin and one crash bug in the `volume_normalization` feature.

There are two new features: the `alsa` mixer plugin normalizes the
displayed value according to human ear perception (with code from
alsamixer).  The new `curl` storage plugin allows using music from a
WebDAV share.
