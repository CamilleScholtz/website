**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.2](/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.2.tar.xz)
has been released.

Again, there are various serious bug fixes for old & new bugs.  The
`alsa` output plugin can now properly play `DSD_U32` (previously
broken), and initial support for `DSD_U16` was added.  The `recorder`
output plugin had a problem with the `format_path` setting.  A general
problem with static noise after song change was fixed.  A problem with
skipping songs within a CUE sheet has been fixed.  The `alsa` input
plugin has a crash bug fix and a major optimization, fixing buffer
overruns.
