The MPD website has been relaunched.  Wikia has been hosting the MPD
website for a few years, but Wikia turned out to be an annoying
experience for many visitors.  Lacking a real maintainer, the wiki
grew into a confusing mess over the years, making it harder and harder
to find the answer to a given problem.  The goal is now to move
helpful information from the old wiki to the [user manual](/doc/user/)
(which nobody knew it existed).

The new website is being managed with [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/)
([LWN article](https://lwn.net/Articles/541299/)).  If you want to
help,
[clone the git repository](http://git.musicpd.org/cgit/master/website.git/)
and
[send a pull request](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/musicpd-dev-team).
The user manual is managed in the
[MPD git repository](http://git.musicpd.org/cgit/master/mpd.git/tree/doc/user.xml).
