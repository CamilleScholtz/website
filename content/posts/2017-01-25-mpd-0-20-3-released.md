**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.3](/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.3.tar.xz)
has been released.

It fixes problems with ReplayGain, the `proxy` database plugin, and the
`playlistadd` command.  When playing stereo on a multi-channel-only
DAC, the two stereo channels are copied only to front-left and
front-right, while the other channels remain silent.
