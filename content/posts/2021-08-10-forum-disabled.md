Today, I have turned off the forum.  Almost all of the traffic in the
last few years was spam; deleting it every day seemed like a waste of
time, and the problem got only worse.  Those who seek support needed
to register yet an account on yet another website, which made the
forum hard to reach.  The forum link now redirects to [GitHub
discussions](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD/discussions);
that also requires an account, but many people already have a GitHub
account.  Those who don't want that can still get MPD support via [IRC
on libera.chat](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/#mpd).
