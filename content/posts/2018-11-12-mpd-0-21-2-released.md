**Music Player Daemon**
[0.21.2](/download/mpd/0.21/mpd-0.21.2.tar.xz)
has been released.

There are three crash bug fixes in the `httpd` plugin (related to the
option `always_on`), the ALSA plugin uses less CPU with dmix, and the
broken zlib support has been fixed.  A bug in the FFmpeg plugin which
caused broken sound was fixed.

In filter expressions, there are two new operators: one matches
substrings, and one uses regular expressions.
