**Music Player Daemon**
[0.21.1](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.21/mpd-0.21.1.tar.xz)
has been released.

It contains the first bunch of fixes for regressions, most of them
build failures.  Two important changes affect the new filter
expressions: strings can now be escaped with backslash and operator
`==` no longer searches substrings.
