**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.7](/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.7.tar.xz)
has been released.

It fixes random crashes when compiled with a recent clang version due
to a new compiler optimization gone wrong.  Two more crash bugs were
fixed which could occur with implausible audio buffer settings.
Directory loop detection on NFS was broken because MPD truncated inode
numbers to 32 bit; now MPD uses the full 64 bit.
