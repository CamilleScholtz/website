Music Player Daemon is finally being ported to Android!  A first
preview for the brave
[has been uploaded to Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.musicpd).

At this early stage of development, the app is not particularly
useful.  There is no user interface, the service is not well
integrated into the Android operating system, and all it can do is
play HTTP streams (MP3, Vorbis, Opus, FLAC).  Stay tuned for updates!
