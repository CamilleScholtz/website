ncmpc
[0.37](/download/ncmpc/0/ncmpc-0.37.tar.xz) has
been released.

This version fixes a bug which broke compatibility with MPD versions
older than 0.21 (ncmpc requires at least MPD 0.19).  The "outputs"
page can manage partitions (MPD 0.22 feature).  The "search" page has
a new filter for file modification time.
