**Music Player Daemon** [0.19.5](/download/mpd/0.19/mpd-0.19.5.tar.xz)
has been released.

It fixes crash and deadlock bugs in the plugins `nfs`, `zzip`,
`dsdiff`, `dsf` and opus.  The `mp4v2` decoder plugin had to be
removed due to a license conflict (MPL 1.1 is not compatible with the
GPL).

For conservative users, Music Player Daemon
[0.18.19](/download/mpd/0.18/mpd-0.18.19.tar.xz) has been released.
It contains backports of the above bug fixes (if applicable).
