**Music Player Daemon**
[0.21.7](/download/mpd/0.21/mpd-0.21.7.tar.xz)
has been released.

Two minor build failure has been fixed (one with `-Dlocal=no` and one
with non-standard `libgcrypt` installation path).  Two Haiku-specific
bugs have been fixed.  The Qobuz/Tidal plugins now load metadata for
songs loaded from a stored playlist.
