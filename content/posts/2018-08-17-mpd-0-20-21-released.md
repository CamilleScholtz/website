**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.21](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.21.tar.xz)
has been released.

The `proxy` database plugin supports more tags and a "password"
setting.  Cuesheets support the non-standard "FLAC" file type.  URI
schemes are case-insensitive.  The Android and Windows builds now have
the `curl` storage plugin (for WebDAV).  The Android build supports
Aarch64 and x86 CPUs.
