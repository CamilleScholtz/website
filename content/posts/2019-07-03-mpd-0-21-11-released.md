**Music Player Daemon**
[0.21.11](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.21/mpd-0.21.11.tar.xz)
has been released.

The command ``list`` supports multiple ``group`` levels (was
implemented improperly until version 0.20.22).  There are various ALSA
specific fixes, improving xrun protection, buffer drain and DSD_U32
support.  The defunct Tidal plugin has been deprecated (Tidal has
changed the protocol).
