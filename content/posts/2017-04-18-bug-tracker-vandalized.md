[A critical Mantis security vulnerability](https://www.mantisbt.org/blog/?p=518)
was used to vandalize the MPD bug tracker through Tor (one day before
the fix was released).  Much of the database has been deleted.

I could curse that it's the usual PHP-style bug, and how I wish there
was a usable non-PHP bug tracker, but it really boils down to my
failure to set up the backup script after migrating to a new server
(which was too long ago already).  D'oh!

Please help: please write new tickets, for bugs and feature requests.
And sorry for the trouble.
