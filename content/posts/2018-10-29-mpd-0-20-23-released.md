**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.23](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.23.tar.xz)
has been released.

The clang compiler bug has caused many more crashes on Android, and
this release contains a more reliable workaround.  Additionally, a
missing `player` idle event has been added and a float-to-s32
conversion bug has been fixed.
