[ncmpc 0.33](/clients/ncmpc) has been released
([source tarball](http://www.musicpd.org/download/ncmpc/0/ncmpc-0.33.tar.xz)).

Fixes a configuration parser bug and a build failure.  Building now
requires Meson 0.47 and a few obsolete options have been removed.  The
"artist" page has been renamed to "library" and the tags on that page
are now configurable.
