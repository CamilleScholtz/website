**Music Player Daemon** [0.18.12](/download/mpd/0.18/mpd-0.18.12.tar.xz)
has been released.

It fixes two build failures with the `proxy` database plugins and
improves stream playback with the decoder plugins `audiofile`,
`dsdiff`, `dsf`, `faad` and `sndfile`.  Two improvements to the
"random" mode ensure that the first and second song being played are
really random.
