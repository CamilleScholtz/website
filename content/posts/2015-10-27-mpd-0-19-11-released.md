**Music Player Daemon**
[0.19.11](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.19/mpd-0.19.11.tar.xz)
has been released.

It fixes a buffer overflow in the `ape` tag plugin, a crash in the
`ffmpeg` decoder and encoder plugin, limits the loop count in the
`gme` decoder and fixes a problem with lagging volume display after
enabling/disabling an output.
