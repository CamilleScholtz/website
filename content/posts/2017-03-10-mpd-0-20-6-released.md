**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.6](/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.6.tar.xz)
has been released.

It fixes the HTTP redirect headers in the `curl` input plugin, stream
tags after automatic song change, and a crash bug in the `mpcdec`
decoder plugin.  Two build failures with old compilers/libraries have
been fixed as well.
