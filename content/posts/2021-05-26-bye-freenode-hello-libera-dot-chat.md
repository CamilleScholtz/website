Last week, the MPD project has moved its IRC channel from Freenode to
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).  This seemed necessary after
[recent events at
Freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode#Ownership_change_and_conflict).
Meanwhile, the original `#mpd` channel on Freenode was [seized by
Freenode staff](https://www.devever.net/~hl/freenode_abuse2).  Point
your IRC client to `irc.libera.chat` and join the new `#mpd` channel!
