**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.20](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.20.tar.xz)
has been released.

A problem with the `modified-since` filter has been fixed.  Pulse
streams are "corked" while paused due to "single" mode.  The DSD
decoders support more MIME types and larger ID3 tags.  The Opus
decoder supports the `R128_ALBUM_GAIN` tag.  The Android and Windows
builds have the `proxy` database plugin.
