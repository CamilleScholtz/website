**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.15](/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.15.tar.xz)
has been released.

A crash bug after seek failure has been fixed, and two bugs related to
restoring mounts from the state file.  The `soxr` resampler clears its
internal state after manual song change.  The Android port no longer
crashes from Android 8's seccomp filter.
