**Music Player Daemon**
[0.21.6](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.21/mpd-0.21.6.tar.xz)
has been released.

There several filter expression fixes, crash bug fixes and other minor
bug fixes (e.g. Opus seeking, Pulse multichannel, ...).

Playlists can be loaded from arbitrary local filesystem paths and the
Linux build supports listening on abstract sockets.

The Windows build no longer requires `libwinpthread-1.dll`.
