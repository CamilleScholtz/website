**Music Player Daemon**
[0.20.22](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.20/mpd-0.20.22.tar.xz)
has been released.

The protocol has seen several bug fixes, e.g. `list ... group` now
works properly.  The `curl` storage plugin encodes paths.  The
experimental Android app can now run as a service.  There is a
workaround for a clang compiler bug which could cause crashes.
