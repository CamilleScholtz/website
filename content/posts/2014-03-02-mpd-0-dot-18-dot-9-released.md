**Music Player Daemon** [0.18.9](/download/mpd/0.18/mpd-0.18.9.tar.xz)
has been released.

It improves the previous workaround for the Raspberry Pi audio driver
bug, eliminating noise during song change.  Child processes launched
by the "pipe" output plugin no longer ignore signals.  Several build
failures have been fixed.
