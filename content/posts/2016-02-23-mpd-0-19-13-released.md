**Music Player Daemon**
[0.19.13](http://www.musicpd.org/download/mpd/0.19/mpd-0.19.13.tar.xz)
has been released.

It fixes a problem with supplementary groups on glibc 2.19+, ID3
parser problems in AIFF and RIFF files, disappearing duration of
remote songs during playback, and adds support for the `TAK` codec in
the `ffmpeg` decoder plugin.
