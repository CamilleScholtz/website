ncmpc [0.26](/download/ncmpc/ncmpc-0.26.tar.xz)
has been released.

This release fixes GCC 7 warnings, eliminates flickering, adds
compatibility with lirc 0.9.4.  DSD and floating point formats are
displayed properly.  The connection to MPD is established
asynchronously, i.e. ncmpc stays responsive while waiting for the
connect.
