ncmpc
[0.31](/download/ncmpc/0/ncmpc-0.31.tar.xz) has
been released.

This release is a major overhaul of the UI look: colors are enabled by
default and different background colors can now be configured.  The
new default color theme is supposed to make ncmpc look more friendly.
At the top, ncmpc shows a list of all pages.

ncmpc considers `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR` for loading its configuration file.
The old path `~/.ncmpc/config` is obsolete, but will be used as
fallback.

The minimum required MPD version has been raised to 0.19.
