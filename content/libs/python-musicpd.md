title: python-musicpd
---

A python 3 only module. python-musicpd is a port of python-mpd to python3 with no intention to support python2.

In comparison with [python-mpd2](../python-mpd2) this module intends to keep things simple (python3 only, no logging), this is a plain evolution of python-mpd.
