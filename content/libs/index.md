title: Client Libraries
---

The following libraries implement the MPD protocol, and may be used to
implement clients.

- [libmpdclient](libmpdclient/) - for C and C++
- [python-mpd2](python-mpd2/) - python 2/3 module, a python-mpd fork.
- [python-musicpd](python-musicpd) - python 3 only, a python-mpd fork.
- [mpcw.client](https://github.com/20centaurifux/mpcw.client) -  Client library written in Java. It implements only a small subset of the protocol.

There are many more client libraries.  Please help and
[add them to this list](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/website).
